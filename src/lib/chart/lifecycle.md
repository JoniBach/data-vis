# **Standard Lifecycle Methodology for Multi-Coordinate Chart Creation**

This document describes the lifecycle methodology for creating charts across different coordinate systems, such as Cartesian, Polar, Geographic, etc. The methodology ensures that charts are developed in a standardized and modular way, allowing for scalability and consistency across multiple chart types.

## **1. Preparation Phase**
- **Purpose**: Prepare and validate the input data to ensure correctness before processing.
- **Functions**:
  - `prepareAndValidateChartData(seriesData, dataKeys)`: Validates the provided dataset and logs errors if any issues are found.
- **Outcome**: Validated data is ready for use, or errors are identified and logged.

## **2. Domain Calculation Phase**
- **Purpose**: Calculate or merge data domains (e.g., x, y, angle, radius) for scaling consistency.
- **Functions**:
  - `computeChartDomains({ syncX, syncY, data, dataKeysArray, features })`: Computes domains across different datasets to ensure alignment, particularly useful for synced charts.
- **Outcome**: Provides the necessary data domains for consistent chart scaling.

## **3. Initialization Phase**
- **Purpose**: Set up the SVG container and scales for the chart.
- **Functions**:
  - `clearChartSvgContainer(container)`: Clears the previous chart elements from the container.
  - `createOrMergeChartContainer(container, width, height, merge)`: Either creates a new SVG container or reuses an existing one based on the merge flag.
  - `initializeBandScales({ dateDomainUsed, chartWidth })`: Initializes appropriate scales (e.g., x-axis band scale).
- **Outcome**: Ready-to-use SVG container and scales.

## **4. Drawing Essentials Phase**
- **Purpose**: Create basic visual elements such as chart groups for axis alignment.
- **Functions**:
  - `createChartGroupWithMargin(svg, margin)`: Adds an SVG group element, with margins applied to allow room for labels and axes.
- **Outcome**: Basic visual elements are in place, ready for feature enrichment.

## **5. Data Binding & Chart Rendering Phase**
- **Purpose**: Bind data to the SVG elements and render the core chart visuals.
- **Functions**:
  - `setupAndRenderCartesianChart({ ... })`: Sets up the scales, axes, and data bindings for elements like bars, lines, or scatter plots.
- **Outcome**: The chart is rendered with the main data visuals, such as lines or bars.

## **6. Feature Enrichment Phase**
- **Purpose**: Enrich the chart with features like axes, labels, tooltips, grids, and legends.
- **Functions**:
  - `renderChartFeatures({ createParams, chartFeatures })`: Adds various features to the chart based on user requirements (e.g., grid lines, labels, tooltips).
  - `featureRegistry`: A registry of available chart features for easy management.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced and feature-rich chart ready for user interaction.

## **7. Interactivity Phase**
- **Purpose**: Add interactivity to the chart, such as tooltips or zooming functionality.
- **Functions**:
  - `initializeChartEventHandlers()`: Sets up event handlers for features like tooltips and hover interactions.
  - `showChartTooltip()`, `moveChartTooltip()`, `hideChartTooltip()`: Manage the tooltip lifecycle.
- **Outcome**: The chart is interactive, allowing users to explore the data.

## **8. Unified Chart Creation Phase**
- **Purpose**: Combine all the above phases to create a comprehensive chart.
- **Functions**:
  - `initializeChart(props)`: Takes all the parameters and runs through each phase to create a complete chart.
- **Outcome**: A fully validated, initialized, rendered, and interactive chart based on input data and configurations.

## **9. Multi-Series Chart Creation (Optional Phase)**
- **Purpose**: Handle multiple datasets to create multi-series charts.
- **Functions**:
  - `createMultiSeriesCartesianChart(props)`: Manages multiple datasets and ensures each series is rendered consistently.
  - `createCartesianDataSeriesChart(props)`: Handles rendering each individual data series within the chart.
- **Outcome**: Multiple data series are rendered on a single chart, allowing for comparative analysis.

### **Diagram Overview**
Consider a flowchart to visualize this lifecycle, with each phase as a distinct block, connected sequentially:
1. **Preparation Phase** ➡️ 2. **Domain Calculation Phase** ➡️ 3. **Initialization Phase** ➡️ 4. **Drawing Essentials Phase** ➡️ 5. **Data Binding & Chart Rendering Phase** ➡️ 6. **Feature Enrichment Phase** ➡️ 7. **Interactivity Phase** ➡️ 8. **Unified Chart Creation Phase** ➡️ 9. **Multi-Series Chart Creation (Optional)**.

- **Arrows** represent the flow between phases.
- **Blocks** represent each lifecycle step.
- **Dashed borders** can indicate optional phases (e.g., Multi-Series Creation).

### **Summary**
This standard lifecycle methodology is designed to ensure consistency, modularity, and scalability across different types of charts and coordinate systems. Each phase contributes to the robustness and interactivity of the resulting visualizations, making it easier to extend and adapt the process to new charting requirements. If you're building a new chart type, you can follow these phases to ensure a standardized approach that maintains high quality and ease of use.
