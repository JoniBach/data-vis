# **Standard Lifecycle Methodology for Multi-Coordinate Chart Creation**

This document describes the lifecycle methodology for creating charts across different coordinate systems, such as Cartesian, Polar, Geographic, etc. The methodology ensures that charts are developed in a standardized and modular way, allowing for scalability and consistency across multiple chart types.

## **Project File Structure Overview**
The project has been organized to follow the standard lifecycle methodology for multi-coordinate chart creation. Each phase in the lifecycle is encapsulated in modular files, grouped by their purpose within the chart creation process. The primary structure is housed within the `chart` directory, with subfolders for each distinct phase.

### **Lifecycle Phases Explained with File Structure**
Each of the 9 phases of the chart lifecycle has a dedicated file or set of files to maintain separation of concerns and to allow for reusability and easy maintenance. Below, we describe how the project folder structure supports each lifecycle phase.

## **1. Preparation Phase** (`lifecycle/preparation.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Preparation Phase ensures that all input data is accurate, well-formatted, and ready to be used in the subsequent steps of the chart lifecycle. It involves validating data structures, identifying errors early, and ensuring data consistency. This phase helps prevent runtime errors and makes the rest of the chart creation process smoother and more reliable.
- **Outcome**: Validated data is ready for use, or errors are identified and logged.

## **2. Domain Calculation Phase** (`lifecycle/domain.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Domain Calculation Phase is focused on defining the range of data that the chart needs to represent. This phase determines the data boundaries (e.g., x-axis, y-axis, angle, radius) to ensure that scaling is consistent across different datasets and charts. Proper domain calculation is crucial for creating accurate visual representations that effectively convey information.
- **Outcome**: Provides the necessary data domains for consistent chart scaling.

## **3. Initialization Phase** (`lifecycle/initialization.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Initialization Phase involves setting up the chart environment, including creating the SVG container and defining the scales. This stage ensures that the necessary drawing space and fundamental visual parameters are in place. A well-initialized environment sets the foundation for an organized and visually appealing chart.
- **Outcome**: Ready-to-use SVG container and scales.

## **4. Drawing Essentials Phase** (`lifecycle/drawingEssentials.js`)
- **Purpose**: In the Drawing Essentials Phase, core visual elements are created, such as chart groups and axis alignment. This phase ensures that the chart has a proper structural framework, allowing for consistent placement of elements like axes, labels, and data points. Properly setting up these basics ensures that later additions, such as data visualization and features, are accurately positioned.
- **Outcome**: Basic visual elements are in place, ready for feature enrichment.

## **5. Data Binding & Chart Rendering Phase** (`lifecycle/dataBinding.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Data Binding & Chart Rendering Phase is where the actual data is tied to visual elements. This phase ensures that the data is accurately represented in the visual elements, such as bars, lines, or scatter plots. Rendering data properly is at the core of creating meaningful and informative charts, enabling users to quickly grasp the presented information.
- **Outcome**: The chart is rendered with the main data visuals, such as lines or bars.

## **6. Feature Enrichment Phase** (`lifecycle/features.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Feature Enrichment Phase adds supplementary elements to the chart, such as axes, labels, tooltips, grids, and legends. These features enhance the user’s understanding and experience by providing context, supporting data interpretation, and making the chart more interactive and informative. This phase turns a basic chart into a rich, user-friendly visualization.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced and feature-rich chart ready for user interaction.

## **7. Interactivity Phase** (`lifecycle/interactivity.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Interactivity Phase focuses on adding interactive capabilities to the chart, such as tooltips, zooming, and panning. Interactivity makes charts more engaging and allows users to explore data in greater depth, uncovering patterns and details that may not be immediately apparent. This phase transforms a static chart into an exploratory tool.
- **Outcome**: The chart is interactive, allowing users to explore the data.

## **8. Unified Chart Creation Phase** (`lifecycle/unifiedChart.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Unified Chart Creation Phase brings together all previous phases to create a complete and cohesive chart. This phase coordinates data preparation, rendering, feature enrichment, and interactivity to ensure that the chart is fully functional, visually appealing, and ready for end-user interaction. It ensures all components work seamlessly together.
- **Outcome**: A fully validated, initialized, rendered, and interactive chart based on input data and configurations.

## **9. Multi-Series Chart Creation (Optional Phase)** (`lifecycle/multiSeries.js`)
- **Purpose**: The Multi-Series Chart Creation Phase is dedicated to handling multiple datasets within a single chart, enabling comparative analysis. This phase allows for the creation of multi-series visualizations, such as grouped bar charts or multiple line graphs, helping users compare different datasets effectively and derive insights from their relationships.
- **Outcome**: Multiple data series are rendered on a single chart, allowing for comparative analysis.

### **Drawing Functions in `/chart/draw`**
The `draw` folder contains functions specifically responsible for rendering different visual components of the chart, further breaking down the rendering logic into modular pieces.

- **`bars.js`**: Contains functions for rendering different types of bars, such as grouped, stacked, overlapped, and error bars.
- **`linesAndAreas.js`**: Contains functions for rendering line and area charts.
- **`points.js`**: Handles rendering individual points in scatter plots or similar charts.
- **`bubbles.js`**: Handles rendering bubble charts, which involve variable radii.
- **`axesAndGrid.js`**: Contains functions to create chart axes, grid lines, and labels for the chart.
- **`tooltips.js`**: Manages the creation and interaction of tooltips, ensuring they appear at the correct position and display relevant information.
- **`utils.js`**: Holds reusable helper functions that are needed across different draw components, such as data preparation and helper calculations.

### **Coordinate Systems Supported**
The following coordinate systems are supported by this methodology, allowing flexibility in the type of visualizations that can be created:

1. **Cartesian Coordinates (x, y)**: Used for line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and area charts.
2. **Polar Coordinates (Radius, Angle)**: Suitable for pie charts, radar charts, and polar bar charts.
3. **Spherical Coordinates**: 3D-like representations, useful for data that maps naturally onto a sphere.
4. **Cylindrical Coordinates**: Charts that require radial positioning combined with height, for cylindrical projections.
5. **Geographic Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude)**: Ideal for visualizing geographic data using maps, choropleths, or geo heatmaps.
6. **Logarithmic Coordinates**: Useful for data that spans multiple magnitudes, especially for financial or scientific data.
7. **Parallel Coordinates**: Enables visualization of high-dimensional data, where multiple attributes can be plotted together.
8. **Ternary and Hexagonal Coordinates**: Specialized for compositional data (ternary plots) and density plots (hexagonal binning).

### **Conclusion**
The `chart` folder is organized in a modular way that reflects the lifecycle methodology for creating multi-coordinate charts. Each lifecycle phase has a dedicated file, and the drawing-related files are further split into distinct types, making the project scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand for developers. This structure facilitates the development of feature-rich, reusable, and customizable chart components across various coordinate systems and chart types.
